Creates a Scripture Cloud of referenced Bible verses in your blog.

== Description ==

This plugin does NOT tag scripture verses and make them clickable links.  It merely finds Bible verses, and displays your most referenced Bible verses in a "Cloud" format.

The verse list is generated and placed into a meta field for the post to improve efficiency.

It uses the built-in WordPress search engine to display scriptures in the cloud (via http://www.yoursite.com/?s="...").
