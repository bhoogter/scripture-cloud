Creates a Scripture Cloud of referenced Bible verses in your blog.

== Description ==

This plugin does NOT tag scripture verses and make them clickable links.  It merely finds Bible verses, and displays your most referenced Bible verses in a "Cloud" format.

The verse list is generated and placed into a meta field for the post to improve efficiency.

It uses the built-in WordPress search engine to display scriptures in the cloud (via http://www.yoursite.com/?s="...").

== Installation ==

1. Get the plugin into the plugin folder
2. Click Activate from the Plugins Page in the Admin Section
3. Drag and configure the "A Scripture Cloud" widget to the appropriate sidebar, clicking Save to record your settings.
